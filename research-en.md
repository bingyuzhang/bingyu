# Research

I am interested in symplectic and contact geometry/topology and related physics.  Now I am focusing on using microlocal sheaf theory to study symplectic geometry of the cotangent bundles. In particular, we can study categories associated with a Lagrangian submanifold, or a domain in cotangent bundles. These categories and functors between them contain lots of geometry information of given Lagrangian submanifolds or domains.

## Paper

 - Chiu-Tamarkin complex as Hochschild (co)homology. Joint with Christopher Kuo. (in preparation)
   We try to explain Chiu-Tamarkin complex conceptrally in terms of the Hochschild (co)homology of the Tamarkin category. We also develop the Chiu-Tamarkin complex of spectrum coefficient, which is a candidate for spectrum coefficient closed string invariant for open sets in cotangent bundles.

 - Contact Non-squeezing at Large Scale via Generating functions. Joint with Maia Fraser and Sheila Sandon. (in preparation)
   We will prove the contact non-squeezing theorem for big balls using generating function homology. Our tool is a new $\mathbb{Z}/k$-equivariant generating function homology.

## Thesis and notes

- [PhD Thesis](Files/PhD_Thesis.pdf) is my PhD thesis. It basically consists of the last two papers above but is not strictly their sum.

- [Generating functions and Sheaves](Files/GF-Sheaves.pdf) is a note for a short lecture within CIRM Spring School on Symplectic and Contact Topology in 2021. The short lecture, given by Sylvain Courte, introduces the basic notions of generating functions and sheaves.

- [M2 thesis](Files/M2_thesis.pdf) is my M2 thesis in Institut Fourier under the supervision of Stéphane Guillermou. It provides a specific construction for the kernel of the projector to the category associated with cubes in symplectic linear spaces.

- On the [CAS master thesis](Files/CAS_Thesis.pdf) (in Chinese), under the supervision of Wei-dong Ruan. I write a note on the proof of the Guillermou-Kashiwara-Schapira sheaf quantization of Hamiltonian.
