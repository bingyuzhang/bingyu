## Publication and preprints

 - [On the Hochschild homology of Tamarkin categories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11447), preprint. Joint with Christopher Kuo and Vivek Shende.
  
 - [Contact non-squeezing at large scale via generating functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11993), preprint. Joint with Maia Fraser and Sheila Sandon.

 - [Idempotence of microlocal kernels and $S^1$-equivariant Chiu-Tamarkin invariant](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12316), preprint.
  
 - [Capacities from the Chiu-Tamarkin Complex](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.05143), to appear in Journal of Symplectic Geometry.
   
## Expository writing 

 - [Non-linear microlocal cut-off functors](Files/Non_linear_microlocal_cut_off_functors.pdf). An unfinished short note of the microlocal cut-off lemma. We extend the definition of microlocal cut-off functors and prove a cut-off lemma adapting new inputs from symplectic geometry. 

## Thesis and notes

- [PhD Thesis](Files/PhD_Thesis.pdf) is my PhD thesis. It basically consists of the last two papers above but is not strictly their sum.

- [Generating functions and Sheaves](Files/GF-Sheaves.pdf) is a note for a short lecture within CIRM Spring School on Symplectic and Contact Topology in 2021. The short lecture, given by Sylvain Courte, introduces the basic notions of generating functions and sheaves.

- [M2 thesis](Files/M2_thesis.pdf) is my M2 thesis in Institut Fourier under the supervision of Stéphane Guillermou. It provides a specific construction for the kernel of the projector to the category associated with cubes in symplectic linear spaces.

- On the [CAS master thesis](Files/CAS_Thesis.pdf) (in Chinese), under the supervision of Wei-dong Ruan. I write a note on the proof of the Guillermou-Kashiwara-Schapira sheaf quantization of Hamiltonian.

## Seminars 

- [Mirror Symmetry](seminar/MirrorSymmetry.md) 2023 Fall.
