# Research

I am interested in symplectic and contact geometry/topology and related physics.  Now I am focusing on using microlocal sheaf theory to study symplectic geometry of the cotangent bundles. In particular, we can study categories associated with a Lagrangian submanifold, or a domain in cotangent bundles. These categories and functors between them contain lots of geometry information of given Lagrangian submanifolds or domains.

## Paper

 - On the Hochschild homology of Tamarkin categories. Joint with Christopher Kuo and Vivek Shende. (in preparation)

 - [Contact non-squeezing at large scale via generating functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11993), preprint. Joint with Maia Fraser and Sheila Sandon.

 - [Idempotence of microlocal kernels and $S^1$-equivariant Chiu-Tamarkin invariant](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12316), preprint.
  
 - [Capacities from the Chiu-Tamarkin Complex](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.05143), to appear in Journal of Symplectic Geometry.
   
   
## Thesis and notes

- [PhD Thesis](Files/PhD_Thesis.pdf) is my PhD thesis. It basically consists of the last two papers above but is not strictly their sum.

- [Generating functions and Sheaves](Files/GF-Sheaves.pdf) is a note for a short lecture within CIRM Spring School on Symplectic and Contact Topology in 2021. The short lecture, given by Sylvain Courte, introduces the basic notions of generating functions and sheaves.

- [M2 thesis](Files/M2_thesis.pdf) is my M2 thesis in Institut Fourier under the supervision of Stéphane Guillermou. It provides a specific construction for the kernel of the projector to the category associated with cubes in symplectic linear spaces.

- On the [CAS master thesis](Files/CAS_Thesis.pdf) (in Chinese), under the supervision of Wei-dong Ruan. I write a note on the proof of the Guillermou-Kashiwara-Schapira sheaf quantization of Hamiltonian.

## Seminars 

- [Mirror Symmetry](seminar/MirrorSymmetry.md) 2023 Fall.
