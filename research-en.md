# Research

I am interested in symplectic and contact geometry/topology and related physics.  Now I am focusing on using microlocal sheaf theory to study symplectic geometry of the cotangent bundles. In particular, we can study categories associated with a Lagrangian submanifold, or a domain in cotangent bundles. These categories and functors between them contain lots of geometry information of given Lagrangian submanifolds or domains.

## Paper

- [Capacities from the Chiu-Tamarkin Complex](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.05143), preprint. 

## Thesis and notes

- [M2 thesis](Files/M2_thesis.pdf) is my M2 thesis in the Institut Fourier, under the supervision of Stéphane Guillermou. It provides a construction of the kernel of the projector to the category associate with cubes in symplectic linear spaces, and then prove a sheaf theory proof of a weak version of the Gromov non-squeezing theorem. As an appendant, it provides a review of some basic results of categories of sheaves we used.

- On the [CAS master thesis](Files/CAS_Thesis.pdf)(in Chinese), under the supervision of Wei-dong Ruan. I write a note on the proof of the Guillermou-Kashiwara-Schapira sheaf quantization of Hamiltonian.
