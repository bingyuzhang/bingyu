## Publication and preprints

 - Non-linear microlocal cut-off functors. Preprint. [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02725).

   A splitting result in an early version of this article is removed. The result is essentially a reprography of Proposition 3.1.10 of [(_Sheaves and symplectic geometry of cotangent bundles_)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.07341) with the present form of cut-off functors.

   On the Hochschild cohomology of Tamarkin categories. Preprint. [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11447). Joint with Christopher Kuo and Vivek Shende.
  
 - Contact non-squeezing at large scale via generating functions. Preprint. [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11993). Joint with Maia Fraser and Sheila Sandon.

 - Idempotence of microlocal kernels and $S^1$-equivariant Chiu-Tamarkin invariant. preprint. [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12316).
  
 - Capacities from the Chiu-Tamarkin Complex. [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.05143). To appear in Journal of Symplectic Geometry.
   

## Thesis and notes

- [PhD Thesis](Files/PhD_Thesis.pdf) is my PhD thesis. It basically consists of the last two papers above but is not strictly their sum.

- [Generating functions and Sheaves](Files/GF-Sheaves.pdf) is a note for a short lecture within CIRM Spring School on Symplectic and Contact Topology in 2021. The short lecture, given by Sylvain Courte, introduces the basic notions of generating functions and sheaves.

- [M2 thesis](Files/M2_thesis.pdf) is my M2 thesis in Institut Fourier under the supervision of Stéphane Guillermou. It provides a specific construction for the kernel of the projector to the category associated with cubes in symplectic linear spaces.

- On the [CAS master thesis](Files/CAS_Thesis.pdf) (in Chinese), under the supervision of Wei-dong Ruan. I write a note on the proof of the Guillermou-Kashiwara-Schapira sheaf quantization of Hamiltonian.
