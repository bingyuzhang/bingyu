# Research

I am interested in symplectic and contact geometry/topology and related physics.  Now I am focusing on using microlocal sheaf theory to study symplectic geometry of the cotangent bundles. In particular, we can study categories associated with a Lagrangian submanifold, or a domain in cotangent bundles. These categories and functors between them contain lots of geometry information of given Lagrangian submanifolds or domains.

## Paper

- [Capacities from the Chiu-Tamarkin Complex](Files/CapacitiesfromCTcomplex.pdf), Draft. 

In the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1405.1178), Shengfu Chiu presents a method to prove the non-squeezing of big contact ball. But the contact invariants he used is still intriguing. 

Now, in this paper, we construct a sequence of symplectic capacities from Chiu-Tamarkin complex. Computationally, they are the same as the Ekeland-Hofer capacities of convex toric domains in the symplectic case. Moreover, they provide new constraints for the embedding problem of contact convex toric domains.  Motivated from the construction and computation of convex toric domains, we expect they are the same as the capacities constructed by [Gutt-Hutchings](https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.agt/1540605650), which is defined by positive $S^1$-equivariant symplectic homology. In fact, we expect some version of identification between Chiu's complex and $S^1$-equivariant symplectic homology.

## Thesis and notes

- [M2 thesis](Files/M2_thesis.pdf) is my M2 thesis in the Institut Fourier, under the supervision of Stéphane Guillermou. It provides a construction of the kernel of the projector to the category associate with cubes in symplectic linear spaces, and then prove a sheaf theory proof of a weak version of the Gromov non-squeezing theorem. As an appendant, it provides a review of some basic results of categories of sheaves we used.

- On the [CAS master thesis](Files/CAS_Thesis.pdf)(in Chinese), under the supervision of Wei-dong Ruan. I write a note on the proof of the Guillermou-Kashiwara-Schapira sheaf quantization of Hamiltonian.
