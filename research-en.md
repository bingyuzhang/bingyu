# Research

I am interested in symplectic and contact geometry/topology and related physics.  Now I am focusing on using microlocal sheaf theory to study symplectic geometry of the cotangent bundles. In particular, we can study categories associated with a Lagrangian submanifold, or a domain in cotangent bundles. These categories and functors between them contain lots of geometry information of given Lagrangian submanifolds or domains.

## Paper

- [Capacities from the Chiu-Tamarkin Complex](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.05143), preprint. 

- Idempotence of microlocal kernels and $S^1$-equivariant Chiu-Tamarkin complex. (Available upon request)

   We present a series of results and constructions about the Chiu-Tamarkin complex that are motivated by the idempotence of microlocal kernels, including: (1) a natural explanation for the definition of the $\mathhb{Z}/\ell$-equivariant Chiu-Tamarkin complex; (2) a graded commutative product on the non-equivariant Chiu-Tamarkin complex; and (3) a construction of the $S^1$-equivariant Chiu-Tamarkin complex. As applications, we: (1) construct a sequence of symplectic capacities $(\overline{c}_k)_{k\in \mathbb{N}}$ and prove that it coincides with the symplectic capacities $({c}_k)_{k\in \mathbb{N}}$ we defined using the $\mathbb{Z}/\ell$-equivariant Chiu-Tamarkin complex under certain conditions; and (2) prove a Viterbo isomorphism. In the appendix, we provide a proof of admissibility for all open sets in a cotangent bundle under the setup of the triangulated category.
   
- Contact Non-squeezing at Large Scale via Generating functions. Joint with Maia Fraser and Sheila Sandon. (in preparation)
  We will prove the contact non-squeezing theorem for big balls using generating function homology. Our basic tool is a new $\mathbb{Z}/k$-equivariant generating function homology.
   
 - Chiu-Tamarkin complex as Hochschild cohomology. (in preparation)
   We prove that the Chiu-Tamarkin complex is isomorphic to the Hochschild cohomology of the Tamarkin category. We also develop the Chiu-Tamarkin complex of spectrum coefficient, which is a candidate for spectrum coefficient closed string invariant for open sets in cotangent bundles.
## Thesis and notes

- [PhD Thesis](Files/PhD_Thesis.pdf) is my PhD thesis. It consists of the two papers above with more details. Specifically, we study the cup product on the non-equivariant Chiu-Tamarkin complex and the $S^1$-equivariant Chiu-Tamarkin complex, and we define capacities using various versions of Chiu-Tamarkin complexes. Last, we make some computations for the convex toric domains and the unit disk bundle. Comments are welcome!

- [Generating functions and Sheaves](Files/GF-Sheaves.pdf) is a note for a short lecture within CIRM Spring School on Symplectic and Contact Topology in 2021. The short lecture, given by Sylvain Courte, introduces the basic notions of generating functions and sheaves.

- [M2 thesis](Files/M2_thesis.pdf) is my M2 thesis in Institut Fourier under the supervision of Stéphane Guillermou. It provides a specific construction for the kernel of the projector to the category associated with cubes in symplectic linear spaces.

- On the [CAS master thesis](Files/CAS_Thesis.pdf) (in Chinese), under the supervision of Wei-dong Ruan. I write a note on the proof of the Guillermou-Kashiwara-Schapira sheaf quantization of Hamiltonian.
