# Research

I am interested in symplectic and contact geometry/topology and related physics.  Now I am focusing on using microlocal sheaf theory to study symplectic geometry of the cotangent bundles. In particular, we can study categories associated with a Lagrangian submanifold, or a domain in cotangent bundles. These categories and functors between them contain lots of geometry information of given Lagrangian submanifolds or domains.

## Paper

- [Capacities from the Chiu-Tamarkin Complex](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.05143), preprint. 

- On the structure of the Chiu-Tamarkin homology. (in preparation)

   In this article, we shall give a cyclic structure as well as various algebraic structures on Chiu-Tamarkin homology. Using the cyclic structure, we can define a version of $S^1$-equivariant Chiu-Tamarkin complex, and explain how we use essentially the $\mathbb{Z}/\ell$-action on the proof of the contact non-squeezing. We also prove a Viterbo isomorphism, demonstrating that the Chiu-Tamarkin homology of open-disk bundle is isomorphic to homology of free loop space. We will test those structures on the homology of free loop space.
## Thesis and notes

- [PhD Thesis](Files/PhD_Thesis.pdf) is my PhD thesis. It consists of the two papers above with more details. Specifically, we study the cup product on the non-equivariant Chiu-Tamarkin complex and the $S^1$-equivariant Chiu-Tamarkin complex, and we define capacities using various versions of Chiu-Tamarkin complexes. Last, we make some computations for the convex toric domains and the unit disk bundle. Comments are welcome!

- [M2 thesis](Files/M2_thesis.pdf) is my M2 thesis in the Institut Fourier, under the supervision of Stéphane Guillermou. It provides a construction of the kernel of the projector to the category associate with cubes in symplectic linear spaces, and then prove a sheaf theory proof of a weak version of the Gromov non-squeezing theorem. As an appendant, it provides a review of some basic results of categories of sheaves we used.

- On the [CAS master thesis](Files/CAS_Thesis.pdf) (in Chinese), under the supervision of Wei-dong Ruan. I write a note on the proof of the Guillermou-Kashiwara-Schapira sheaf quantization of Hamiltonian.
