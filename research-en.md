# Research

I am interested in symplectic and contact geometry/topology and relate physics.  Now I am focusing on using microlocal sheaf theory to study symplectic geometry of the cotangent bundles. In particular, we can study categories associated to a Lagrangian submanifold or a domain in cotangent bundles. These categories and functors between them contain lots of geometry information of given Lagrangian submanifolds or domains.

## Paper

- Furthur study on Chiu's invariant(Coming soon). In [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1405.1178), Shengfu Chiu present a method to prove non-squeezing of big contact ball. But the contact inavariants he used is still intriguing. Now we are going on further on these invariants, for example try to understand the embedding problem of ellipsoids by using Chiu's invariants. 

  So far, we can construct a sequence of capacities from Chis' invariant. Computationally, they are the same with the Ekeland-Hofer capacities of convex toric domain in the symplectic case. Moreover, they provide new constrains for the embedding problem of contact convex toric domains.  Motivited from the construction and computation of convex toric domains, we expect they are the same with the capacites constructed by [Gutt-Hutchings](https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.agt/1540605650), which is defined from positive $S^1$-equivariant symplectic homology. In fact, we expect some version of identification between Chiu's invariant and $S^1$-equivariant symplectic homology.

## Thesis and notes

- [M2 thesis](M2_thesis.pdf) is my M2 thesis in the Institute Fourier, under the supervison of Stéphane Guillermou. It provides a construction of the kernel of the projector to the category associate to cubes in symplectic linear spaces, and then prove a sheaf theory proof of a weak version of the Gromov non-squeezing theorem. As a appendant, it provides a review on some basic results of categories of sheaves we used.

- On the [CAS master thesis](CAS_Thesis.pdf)(in Chinese), under the supervision of Wei-dong Ruan. I write a note on the proof of the Guillermou-Kashiwara-Schapira sheaf quantization of Hamiltonian.
