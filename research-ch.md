# 研究

我对辛与切触几何(拓扑)及相关物理有兴趣. 目前, 我主要致力于用微局部层论研究余切丛的辛几何. 特别地, 对每个拉格朗日子流形或余切丛中的区域, 我们有一个相应的范畴. 这些范畴及其之间的函子
In particular, we can study categories associated to a Lagrangian submanifold or a domain in cotangent bundles. These categories and functors between them contain lots of geometry information of given Lagrangian submanifolds or domains.

## Paper

- Furthur study on Chiu's invariant(In preparing). In [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1405.1178), Shengfu Chiu present a method to prove non-squeezing of big contact ball. But the contact inavariants he used is still intriguing. Now we are going on further on this invariants, for example try to understand the embedding problem of ellipsoids by Chiu's invariants.

## Thesis and notes

- [M2 thesis](M2_thesis.pdf) is my M2 thesis in the Institute Fourier, under the supervison of Stéphane Guillermou. It provides a construction of the kernel of the projector to the category associate to cubes in symplectic linear spaces, and then prove a sheaf theorical proof of a weak version of the Gromov non-squeezing theorm. As a appendant, it provides a review on some basic results of categories of sheaves we used.

- On the [CAS master thesis](CAS_Thesis.pdf)(in Chinese), under the supervision of Weidong Ruan. I write a note on the proof of the Guillermou-Kashiwara-Schapira sheaf quantization of Hamiltionian.
