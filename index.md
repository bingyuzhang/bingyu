## Profile

Currently, I am a first year PhD student in Institute Fourier from Oct.2019. My advisors are Damien Gayet(IF, UGA), Stéphane Guillermou(IF, UGA), and Claude Viterbo(ENS Ulm).

Here is my [CV](CV.pdf).

## Research

I am interested in symplectic and contact geometry/topology and relate physics.  Now I am focus on using microlocal sheaf theory to study symplectic geometry of the cotangent bundles. In particular, we can study categories associated to a Lagrangian submanifold or a domain in cotangent bundles. These categories and functors between them contain lots of geometry information of given Lagrangian submanifolds or domains.

-Furthur study of Chiu's invariant(In preparing). In [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1405.1178), Chiu's present a method to prove Non-squeezing of big contact ball. But the contact inavariants he used is still intriguing. Now we are going on further on this invariants, for example embedding problem of ellipsoids.

- [M2thesis](M2_thesis.pdf) is my M2 thesis in Institute Fourier, under supervison of Stéphane Guillermou. It provides a construction of the kernel of the projector to the category associate to cubes in symplectic linear spaces, and then prove a sheaf theorical proof of a weak version of the Gromov Non-squeezing theorm. As a appendant, it provides a review on some basic results of categories of sheaves we used.

-On the [CAS master thesis](CAS_Thesis)(in Chinese), we write a note on the proof of the Guillermou-Kashiwara-Schapira sheaf quantization.
