## Profile

Currently, I am a first year PhD student of Institute Fourier from Oct.2019. My advisors are Damien Gayet(IF, UGA), Stéphane Guillermou(IF, UGA), and Claude Viterbo(ENS Ulm).

I complete my bachelor degree in the [School of Mathematics, Human University](http://math.hnu.edu.cn/), Changsha, Beijing, and my first master degree in the [Academy of Mathematics and Systems Science, Chinese Academy of Science](http://www.math.ac.cn/), Beijing, China.

Here is my [CV](CV.pdf).

# Research

I am interested in symplectic and contact geometry/topology and relate physics.  Now I am focus on using microlocal sheaf theory to study symplectic geometry of the cotangent bundles. In particular, we can study categories associated to a Lagrangian submanifold or a domain in cotangent bundles. These categories and functors between them contain lots of geometry information of given Lagrangian submanifolds or domains.

## Paper

- Furthur study on Chiu's invariant(In preparing). In [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1405.1178), Chiu's present a method to prove Non-squeezing of big contact ball. But the contact inavariants he used is still intriguing. Now we are going on further on this invariants, for example embedding problem of ellipsoids.

## Thesis and notes

- [M2 thesis](M2_thesis.pdf) is my M2 thesis in the Institute Fourier, under the supervison of Stéphane Guillermou. It provides a construction of the kernel of the projector to the category associate to cubes in symplectic linear spaces, and then prove a sheaf theorical proof of a weak version of the Gromov Non-squeezing theorm. As a appendant, it provides a review on some basic results of categories of sheaves we used.

- On the [CAS master thesis](CAS_Thesis.pdf)(in Chinese), under the supervision of Weidong Ruan. I write a note on the proof of the Guillermou-Kashiwara-Schapira sheaf quantization of Hamiltionian.

# Teaching
