# Toric variety and F-theory

This is a PhD topics course *Advanced topics in Quantum Mathematics* at CQM on Spring 2025. We will discuss basic toric geometry and certain applycations in Physics, especially in F-theory.

Bingyu will instruct the toric geometry part. Muyang will instruct the F-theory part.

The lecture note is [here](/Files/toric.pdf).
